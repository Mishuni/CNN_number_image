# CNN_number_image
AI that can classify the number 0~9 from the image by training through CNN algorithm


Image Processing (collect_image funtion)

1. Input image

2. Convert the Input image to Gray Image 
 
3. Gaussian smoothing (removing noise)
 
4. Thresholding (make a region of number light)
 
5. Extracting the region of number from the image


AI Training (CNN algorithm)
